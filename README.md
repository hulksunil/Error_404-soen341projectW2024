### 5. Security Considerations
Security measures for the frontend and backend would be user privacy. For the front end, we will have multiple layers of validation. We will first validate that all user input fields are the correct type and valid information for our database, for example start date, end date, and username would require validation before being passed to the database. Our second major validation system would be sanitizing all input fields to prevent any SQL injections and Cross Site scripting. For the backend we will be implementing hashing and salting on the users’ passwords in the case of a security breach.
